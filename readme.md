# FlappyDragons

My choice of projects for learning C/C++. A flappy bird clone. None of the graphics are mine.
I procured all gfx from opengameart.org

This is what I have so far over the course of about 4 days.

So far I've only built it in linux, the raylib library is compiled as a shared library so you'll need that. 

type make, then type ./flappydragon
